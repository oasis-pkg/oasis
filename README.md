# ðŸ“¦ Oasis - All packages, one place

Oasis is an unified package search engine to find any kind of packages in one place.

## Development notice

This is a new project and I'm working on it. I'll publish all changes, but it won't be available for production until I add the main features.

Code is full of "FIXME" tags because code needs several refactors, optimizations and improvements.

In addition, I'm working on another project, so this could not have any update for a few weeks.
