# ðŸ“¦ Oasis - All packages, one place

Oasis is an unified package search engine to find any kind of packages in one place.

This is a new project and I'm working on it. I'll publish all changes, but it won't be available for production until I add the main features.
In addition, I'm working on another project, so this could not have any update for a few weeks.
